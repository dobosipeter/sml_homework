# sml_homework
This repository contains my submission to the homework assignment of my [Supervised Machine Learning (VEMISAM146F)](https://moodle.uni-pannon.hu/course/view.php?id=23598) course.  
  
## Description  

The assignment is rather broad, it only states that we should pick a classification or regression problem and solve it. I have to use a Jupyter notebook to solve the problem and present my submission.    
After some consideration, I've decided to pick an [active classification problem](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e11/overview) from Kaggle. Its aim is to predict loan paybacks.  
I will track my work in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dobosipeter/sml_homework).
